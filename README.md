The zip contains CUHK-CR1 (The RGB images for thin dataset CUHK-CR1), CUHK-CR2 (The RGB images for think dataset CUHK-CR2), nir (the near-infrared images for CUHK-CR1 and CUHK-CR2). If you need image with 4 bands (RGB + nir), you could load the images in the RGB dataset and the nir dataset and combine the 4 channels together.
